# Python Directory Overview

This directory, `Python`, is part of the **My Educational Oasis** repository. It is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for self-study, covering everything from basic Python syntax to advanced libraries and practical projects. The content here allows you to review and reinforce your Python skills and indirectly gauge your learning progress.

## Directory Structure

The `Python` directory is organized into three main subdirectories:

### 1. [Basic](Basic)

The `Basic` directory provides fundamental knowledge about Python. It includes:

- **Basic Syntax**: Introduction to Python syntax and basic programming constructs.
- **Data Types**: Understanding Python's built-in data types, including strings, numbers, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- **Control Structures**: Study of conditionals (if-else statements) and loops (for and while loops).
- **Functions**: Basic function definitions, arguments, and return values.
- **Built-in Functions**: Overview of Python's built-in functions and their usage.

This folder is intended for building a solid foundation in Python programming.

### 2. [Library](Library)

The `Library` directory focuses on Python's powerful libraries and frequently used external modules. It includes:

- **[Pandas](pandas)**: Documentation and examples for using Pandas, a data manipulation and analysis library.
- **[NumPy](numpy)**: Resources for NumPy, a library for numerical computations and handling arrays.

This folder is crucial for learning and mastering key libraries that extend Python's capabilities and provide tools for data analysis, scientific computing, and more.

### 3. [Project](Project)

The `Project` directory contains simple programs and projects that apply the skills learned from the other directories. It includes:

- **Practical Applications**: Examples of how to implement Python concepts and libraries in real-world scenarios.
- **Mini Projects**: Small projects that demonstrate the application of Python skills in different contexts.

This folder is designed to help you practice and consolidate the skills you've acquired, turning theoretical knowledge into practical experience.
