# Python Directory Overview

This directory, `Python`, is part of the **My Educational Oasis** repository. It is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for self-study, covering everything from basic Python syntax to advanced libraries and practical projects. The content here allows you to review and reinforce your Python skills and indirectly gauge your learning progress.

## Directory Structure

The `Python` directory is organized into three main subdirectories:

### 1. [Basic](Basic)

Although this directory was designed to establish a foundation in Python, and I have not actively maintained it for some time due to its initial purpose, it still contains essential materials that are crucial for becoming a proficient Python programmer. Therefore, it remains necessary to be familiar with the contents of this directory.

### 2. [Library](Library)

The `Library` directory focuses on Python's powerful libraries and frequently used external modules. I can confidently say that this is the most important section of my Python directory, where I spend the most time.
It is organized into the following sections:

- [Data Analysis](Data_Analysis)
  - **[Pandas](pandas)**: Comprehensive documentation and examples for Pandas, a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
  - **[NumPy](numpy)**: Resources and tutorials for NumPy, a library designed for numerical computations and array handling.
  - **[Matplotlib](matplotlib)**: Guides and examples for Matplotlib, a library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
  - **[Seaborn](seaborn)**: Instructions for using Seaborn, a statistical data visualization library built on Matplotlib that offers a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative graphics.
- [Machine Learning](MC_Learning)
- [Web App](Web_App)
- [Crawling](Crawling)

This directory is essential for learning and mastering key libraries that extend Python's capabilities, offering tools for data analysis, scientific computing, and visualization. Additionally, the `Library` directory includes a `notes.md` file, which contains valuable insights and tips that may not be immediately familiar to beginners. This file is a useful resource if you encounter difficulties during your studies, providing handy information to support your learning journey.


### 3. [Project](Project)

The `Project` directory contains simple programs and projects that apply the skills learned from the other directories. It includes:

- **Practical Applications**: Examples of how to implement Python concepts and libraries in real-world scenarios.
- **Mini Projects**: Small projects that demonstrate the application of Python skills in different contexts.

This folder is designed to help you practice and consolidate the skills you've acquired, turning theoretical knowledge into practical experience.
